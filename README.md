* Modular profiles: Your profile can be as detailed as you want. Add your socials, talk about as many projects or work experiences as you want, enrich project descriptions with URLs to code repos or videos, etc.
* OAuth: Create new profiles through the registration form or authenticate through Google.
* Animated gradient background: Not really a feature but makes for great mood lighting!
